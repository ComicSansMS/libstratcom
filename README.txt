 libstratcom - A cross-platform library for interfacing
               with the Microsoft SideWinder Strategic Commander
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 -- Requirements --

This library will work on Windows, MacOS X and Linux.
A C++11 aware compiler is required for compilation (gcc 4.8, clang 3.6,
Visual Studio 2013).

On Linux, the libudev development package needs to be installed (libudev-dev
on Debian-based systems).


 -- Compilation --

This library uses CMake (http://cmake.org/) for building.

CMake will generate a build environment suited to your platform. This might
be Makefiles on a Unix-like system or Visual Studio project files on a
Windows system.

For example, to build and install the library on a *nix system, it is
usually sufficient to run:

    cd <source_directory>
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install


 -- Documentation --

This library uses Doxygen for documentation.

Documentation can be generated by running the doxygen-doc build target.

    make doxygen-doc

This will write the documentation files to the doc subdirectory in the
build directory.

A number of example applications that demonstrate how to use the library
are included in the examples directory.


 -- License --

The libstratcom library can be used under the MIT/X11 license.
It requires the HIDAPI library as a dependency, which can be used under the
terms of the BSD license.

See the enclosed LICENSE.txt file for details.
